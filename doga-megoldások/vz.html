    <h1>This is the main headline of the article</h1>
    <h2>This is a second level heading</h2>
    <p>Here comes the first paragraph of text that describes what this article will be about. <strong>Its second sentence is so important it gets marked additionally.</strong>
</p>
    <blockquote>"Then comes a longer quotation from long ago that makes you think."</blockquote>
    <p>In the second paragraph there is nothing interesting. But after the second paragraph there is an image of a tree.</p>

      <li>under each other
        <ul>
          <li>and second level items</li>
          <li>also</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
